### Incorporation
The entity was initially incorporated as "NewCoin Inc."[^SoS-NewCoin] on 19 September 2012, then renamed to "OpenCoin Inc."[^SoS-OpenCoin] on 3 October 2012, and finally renamed to "Ripple Labs Inc."[^SoS-Ripple] on 18 October 2013.

### Founders


The idea for the company came about 

https://xrpl.org/history.html
https://xrpl.org/history.html

In early 2011, three developers—David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto—were fascinated with Bitcoin but observed the waste inherent in mining. They sought to create a more sustainable system for sending value (an idea outlined in a May 2011 forum post: “Bitcoin without mining”)[^Bitcoin_Talk].

Their initial observations about the high energy consumption and scalability issues that would plague Bitcoin proved prescient. In 2019, estimates suggest Bitcoin mining used more energy than the entire country of Portugal. Moreover, their initial read indicated that significant problems could arise if any miner obtained (or miners colluded to obtain) greater than 50% of the mining power. That risk persists with Bitcoin (and Ethereum) today as mining power has consolidated in China.

Global Regulation
Update on the SEC Lawsuit Against Ripple
Total XRP sales by Ripple in Q1 2023, net of purchases, were $361.06M v. $226.31M the previous quarter.
XRP Ledger on-chain activity remained strong, with decentralized exchange volumes increasing 34% to $115M in Q1 2023 versus Q4 2022. XRP Average Daily Volume (ADV) on centralized exchanges jumped 46% in Q1 to $1B from $698M.
The EU, UK and UAE proposed new regulatory regimes for crypto focused on licensing and activity-based frameworks.
Developers proposed a new interoperability standard (XLS-38d) for the XRP Ledger that would enable users to transfer digital assets and data between blockchains regardless of underlying protocol or programming language.

On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)

Bitso, the leading crypto exchange in Latin America, announced last quarter it surpassed more than $3.3 billion in transactions between the US and Mexico in 2022 through its institutional crypto solutions utilizing Bitso’s strategic partners, such as Ripple and its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. This partnership illustrates the institutional use of cryptocurrency as a cross-border payment solution and an example of the utility of blockchain and crypto.
