# Ripple Labs - Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* *Name of company*   
Ripple Labs Inc. ("Ripple").

* *When was the company incorporated?*   
In short, 2011. The entity was initially incorporated as "NewCoin Inc."[^SoS-NewCoin] on 19 September 2012, then renamed to "OpenCoin Inc."[^SoS-OpenCoin] on 3 October 2012, and finally renamed to "Ripple Labs Inc."[^SoS-Ripple] on 18 October 2013.

* *Who are the founders of the company?*   
Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the company[^tracxn].

* *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*   
 Chris attributes the idea for the company's key product, the XRP Ledger, originating in 2004 from the "Ripple Project" initially conceived by Ryan Fuger.

  In early 2011, three developers—David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto—were fascinated with Bitcoin but observed the waste inherent in mining. They sought to create a more sustainable system for sending value \(an idea outlined in a May 2011 forum post: [“Bitcoin without mining”](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10193.0)\)[^Bitcoin_Talk].

* *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*   
    Ripple has raised a total of $293.8M in funding over 14 rounds between May 2015 to August 2021 from 43 different investors.[^CrunchBase]

## Business Activities:

* *What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*   
Ripple's crypto and blockchain solutions are designed to "move, manage and tokenize value" predominantly for the following use cases:
   * Cross-Border Payments: Enable global money transfers
   * Crypto Liquidity: Source digital assets
   * Central Bank Digital Currency: Implement CBDCs

* *Who is the company's intended customer?*   
  Ripple is mainly targeting business customers[^RippleAbout] such as banks and financial institutions, that in turn use Ripple solutions for various types of consumers. Some examples of these include:  
  * [Siam Commercial Bank: Enabling better payouts](https://ripple.com/customer-case-study/scb/)  
  * [Nium: Eliminating prefunding](https://ripple.com/customer-case-study/nium/)
  * [MoneyMatch: Offering lower-cost remittances](https://ripple.com/customer-case-study/moneymatch/)

* *Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*   
  In 2021, Ernest &amp; Young[^EYFlows] estimated the total global cross-border payment flow to exceed US$156 trillion by 2022, with a <a title="compound annual growth rate" href=".">CAGR</a> of 5%, segmented as follows:

<a title="This week’s events" href="events/2003/20031027t1722z001.htm">More</a>

    | Segment | Value | Notes |
    | :--- | :---: | :--- |
    |Business-to-Business (B2B)| US$150t |Transactions make up the largest share by far.|
    |Consumer-to-Business (C2B)| US$2.8t |Cross-border e-commerce and offline tourism spend.|
    |Business-to-Consumer (B2C)| US$1.6t |Wage salaries or interest payments.|
    |Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)| US$0.8t | Remittance payments.|

* *What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*   
  Ripple aims to disrupt the status quo of cross-border payments. Through the use of blockchain and modern APIs, Ripple enables financial institutions who are part of the network "RippleNet" to send money globally, instantly, reliably and for fractions of a penny. Being part of RippleNet solves three key issues with payments:
  1. Speed and certainty
  1. Liquidity management
  1. Transparency

  With RippleNet, customers can quickly access new markets, expand their services and deliver the best customer experience in global payments today. With a single connection, customers can access the best blockchain technology for global payments, payout capabilities in over 40 currencies, On-Demand Liquidity as an alternative to pre-funding and operational consistency through a common rulebook.[^RippleFAQ]

  Table 2 provides a further comparison of XRP's technology with other prominent cryptocurrencies, highlighting that XRP has been designed with payments, speed, throughput and efficiency in mind. 

  | Cryptocurrency / Blockchain | Bitcoin\/Bitcoin | Ether/Ethereum |	XRP/XRP Ledger|
  |:---| :---| :--- | :--- |
  |Key Use  | Store of Value   |Smart Contracts  |  Payments |
  |Speed to Transact \(seconds\) | 409.98  | 300.00 |  3.83 |
  |Cost per Transaction (US$)  | $0.465 | $9.00 | $0.0002 |
  |Transactions Per Second | 5 | 10 | 1,500 \(max\)|

  ***Table 2:*** Approximative Comparison of Different Cryptocurrencies[^RippleCryptoIntro]
  
  Kohli et al[^Kohli-2023] suggest XRP is significantly more energy efficient than other major cryptocurrencies - in the case of BitCoin, up to 100,000 times more efficient, although there are other cryptocurrencies such as Hedera which are even more efficient than XRP.
